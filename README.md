I am a Telecommunications Engineer with a solid foundation in infrastructure, data analysis, and network operations, now fully focused on the fields of Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Cloud Computing. With over a decade of experience bridging technical domains, I bring a systems-oriented mindset and business-driven approach to every project I work on.

Currently, I am leading data analytics and automation efforts in a large-scale government initiative in Mexico, applying tools like Power BI, SQL, and Python to build actionable dashboards and automated KPIs. Previously, I managed network monitoring systems and high-availability VoIP platforms, gaining deep experience in CDR analysis, MySQL, and operational troubleshooting at scale.

To support my transition into AI and Data Science, I’ve earned multiple industry-recognized certifications, including:

AWS Machine Learning Engineer Associate

Google Cloud Digital Leader

Power BI Data Analyst Associate

ITIL 4 Specialist – Plan, Implement and Control

MLOps Zoomcamp Graduate (DataTalks Club)

Machine Learning Zoomcamp Graduate (DataTalks Club)

I’ve designed and deployed ML pipelines with TensorFlow, XGBoost, MLflow, and orchestrated end-to-end data workflows using tools such as Kestra, dbt, Terraform, and GCP services (BigQuery, Cloud Storage, Looker Studio). I’m passionate about building scalable, reproducible, and production-ready ML systems aligned with real business needs.

Beyond technical execution, I’m deeply interested in the ethical and sustainable application of AI, and continuously explore how best practices in IT Service Management (ITIL) can complement MLOps and LLMOps strategies.

On GitHub, I share open projects, notebooks, and frameworks that reflect both my learning journey and my commitment to responsible innovation. I'm always open to collaboration—whether it's solving complex data challenges, building production ML pipelines, or contributing to open-source initiatives.
